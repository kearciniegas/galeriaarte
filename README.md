## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Responsive Design
- CSS Animations
- Media queries

### What I learned

This challenge was for sure one of the hardest until now. Was my first time using `grid-template-area` and was a great exercise to learn this tool. Another aspect that was great doing this challenge was the opportunity to use JS library for the fist time adding the maps with `Leaflet`. Great and amazing challenge.
